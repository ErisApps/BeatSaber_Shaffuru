# Shaffuru | シャッフル

Endless Mode evolved. You pick a duration to play for and it keeps feeding you songs that you have downloaded in a random order.

### But there is more!

- You can filter the songs that should be in the map pool in various ways (Using a Playlist, Using NPS / NJS Limits and more!)
- You can make songs start and end at a random point instead of playing through its entirety! This was formerly called CHAOSMOD and is what this mod started out as
- You can accept requests from Twitch chat for songs to be played, and if you want to, even allow a specific difficulty (And Start time) to be requested - The request still has to match your configured filters.
- Compatible with JDFixer / NJSFixer preferences. Ideally you should set those up so you dont play with the same JD on slow and fast songs

## Install

For now - **Make sure to not use any mods that disable score submission** as that will softlock you once the level ends. I am not sure why yet. One of those mods would be "PlayFirst".

#### You can always find the latest Download in [the releases](https://github.com/kinsi55/BeatSaber_Shaffuru/releases)

### Requirements (All Availalbe in ModAssistant)

- **SongCore**
- **SiraUtil**
- **BeatSaberMarkupLanguage**
- **SongDetailsCache**
- **ChatCore** (Optional, only needed if you want Chat requests to work)

## How to Play

Click the Shaffuru Mod Button in the Main Menu, configure the Settings as you please and then click the Play button at the bottom. It will tell you how many maps you have that fit your configured options, give you an option to pick how long you want to play and off you go.

## Limitations

- If a map has any requirement it cannot be played
- Score submission obviously isnt gonna happen
- Only maps that you already have downloaded can be requested at the moment. I might be able to change this in the future
- Some Counters / Mods dont like this like the "Notes left" and "PB" display, they'll just display garbage
